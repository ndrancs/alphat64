* Setup timezone, change keyboard layout and locale settings
  In order to keep time properly, you need to select your timezone 
  so that your system knows where it is located. The timezone under 
  Linux is set by a symbolic link from /etc/localtime to a file in the 
  /usr/share/zoneinfo directory that corresponds with what timezone you 
  are in. Example: ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Paris /etc/localtime.
  Please avoid the /usr/share/zoneinfo/Etc/GMT* timezones as their names 
  do not indicate the expected zones. For instance, GMT-8 is in fact GMT+8.
  
  To set and customize all keyboard layout settings in the X you can use the 
  setxkbmap command in /root/.start. The list of predefined options can be 
  found right on the system, in: /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/base.lst
  
  Before a locale can be used on the system, it has to be enabled first.
  To enable a locale, uncomment the name of the locale in the file /etc/locale.gen. 
  This file contains all the available locales that can be used on the system. 
  Revert the process to disable a locale. After the necessary locales are enabled, 
  the system needs to be updated with the new locales: locale-gen. Now open 
  /etc/rc.conf and change to suitable system language (french in this example) 
  LOCALE="fr_FR.UTF-8"

* User accounts
  By default, alphaOS has two user accounts: one is root with password toor, 
  and other is alpha with password alpha. Home directory for restricted user 
  alpha is /home/alpha. Once the system finishes booting, you will be 
  logged in as root, and to start some application as unprivileged user, 
  first open terminal and substitute user root with alpha, i.e. type: su alpha.
  
* How to log in as user alpha?
  Right click in desktop, select Logout, ALT+F2, login as user:pass = alpha:alpha
