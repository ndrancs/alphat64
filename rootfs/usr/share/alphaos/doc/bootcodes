  Kernel boot parameters are text strings which are interpreted by the system 
  to change specific behaviors and enable or disable certain features. 
  
  Kernel parameters can be set either temporarily by editing the boot menu when 
  it shows up, or by modifying the boot loader's configuration file, menu.lst.
  
  Kernel boot parameters:
  
    - are case-sensitive,

    - are sometimes just a simple word ("dofsck")

    - sometimes have an = sign with various possible values (base2ram=yes)

    - sometimes include punctuation ("i8042.noloop") 
  
  > List of official Linux Live bootcodes:

===========================================================================
  
basesfs=location, or basesfs=none, or basesfs=ask

location options
initrd:path             use basesfs contained inside initrd
local:path:crypt        search for basesfs in all local devices
usb:path:crypt          search for basesfs in all usb devices
device:dev:path:crypt   use basesfs/basedir in specified device
label:label:path:crypt  use basesfs/basedir in device with specified label
uuid:uuid:path:crypt    use basesfs/basedir in device with specified uuid
cifs:user:pass:unc:path use basesfs/basedir in specified cifs share
nbd:host:port:crypt     use specified nbd device as basesfs device

Note
crypt is optional, path is optional except for local and usb.
path is path to the basesfs or base directory. For cifs, user=+ means ask for user/password.
crypt means that the device/partition is encrypted. Not the basesfs file.
Use crypt for cryptoloop, dmcrypt for dm-crypt (LUKS).

===========================================================================

savefile=layer:location, or savefile=none, or savefile=ask

layer options
ram                     use RAM layer with periodic saving to actual savefile
direct                  use savefile directly 

location options
local:path:crypt        search for savefile in all local devices
usb:path:crypt          search for savefile in all usb devices
device:dev:path:crypt   use savefile/savedir in specified device
label:label:path:crypt  use savefile/savedir in device with specified label
uuid:uuid:path:crypt    use savefile/savedir in device with specified uuid
cifs:user:pass:unc:path use savefile/savedir in specified cifs share
nbd:host:port:crypt     use specified nbd device as save device
multi:dev:path:n        multisession with device, don't load last n sessions

Note
crypt is optional, path is optional except for local and usb.
path is path to the savefile or save directory. For cifs, user=+ means ask for user/password.
crypt means that the device/partition is encrypted. Not the savefile file.
Savefile file is also encrypted if its filename has the word _crypt_ in it.
Use crypt and _crypt_ for cryptoloop, dmcrypt and _dmcrypt_ for dm-crypt (LUKS).

===========================================================================

net=type:device-settings:ip-address or net=ask

type options
wired                   use wired device
wpa or wpa2             use wireless device with wpa or wpa2 security

device-settings for wired
device                  network device name e.g eth0, eth1

device-settings for wpa/wpa2: ssid:password:device
ssid                    wireless SSID
password                wireless password for WPA/WPA2
device                  wireless device e.g wlan0

IP address options: dhcp or ip:ip-address:netmask:gateway:dns
dhcp                    the string "dhcp", system will get IP address from dhcp
ip                      the string "ip", system will set static IP as follows
ip-address              IP address (e.g. 192.168.1.50)
netmask                 network mask (e.g. 255.255.255.0)
gateway                 optional IP address of network gateway (e.g. 192.168.1.1)
dns                     optional IP address of dns server (e.g. 8.8.8.8)

===========================================================================

base2ram=yes            If you use external basesfs, use this to load basesfs into RAM
search[=n]              Search all savefiles in directories up to n-th level (default 1)
waitdev=n               Wait n seconds for devices to settle and be detected
dofsck                  Check (and fix) filesystems before mounting - only for ext2/3/4
withlvm                 Activate LVM partition on boot
withmdadm               Activate mdadm Linux software RAID partition on boot
acpi=off                Default on for PCs >2001, may give boot/shutdown probs.
pci=noacpi              May solve boot boot problems on some hardware.
pci=nocrs               Discard pci ACPI information. Fixes boot failures.(t3500)
loglevel=<n>            Bootup verbosity. 7 is high verbosity for debugging.
blacklist               List of modules to blacklisted, comma separated
loadmodules             List of modules to be loaded, comma separated
pfix=nox                Commandline only, do not start X.
pfix=xorgwizard         Start xorgwizard before launching desktop.
