A frugal install, as characterized by most Linux distros that use it, is
a technique that copies the CDROM boot files as is, directly to a hard 
drive. The distro can then boot from these files and operate as if it had 
booted from the CDROM. 

This lets the user bypass the sometimes lengthly and messy full install 
procedure. Not all distributions are set up to do such a thing. But for 
those that are, they need only a handful of files to be copied to the 
hard drive, making for a very simple and fast install.

A frugal install is similar to running a live cd or live usb, except that 
it is running from a hard drive. Advantages of frugal:

  - Space is saved (installation to hard drive typically is 4 times the 
    size of the iso, whereas with frugal it is the size of the iso).

  - Frugal from hard drive is faster than live usb and live cd.

  - Great for testing (once set up). 

The frugal alphat installation is like fatdog64 v630.

The example menu.lst will have these entries:

title alphat64 K3.14.0 - sda1 - in folder alphat64 - frugal
  kernel /alphat64/vmlinuz basesfs=device:sda1:/alphat64/alphat64_100.sfs dofsck
  initrd /alphat64/initrd64

title alphat32 K3.14.0 - sda1 - in folder alphat32 - frugal
  kernel /alphat32/vmlinuz basesfs=device:sda1:/alphat32/alphat32_100.sfs dofsck
  initrd /alphat32/initrd

The same method can be applied for installation to a USB flash drive.
