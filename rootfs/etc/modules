# /etc/modules
#
# This file contains a list modules to be loaded by the system.
# Modules listed here will always be loaded regardless of whether they are
# required. List one module per line. Anything after hash mark is a comment.
#
# Note: Modules listed here take precedence over module blacklist;
#       they will *always* be loaded regardless of blacklist.
