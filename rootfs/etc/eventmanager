# The following parameters, together, controls non-root access level to

# Set it to 770/007 for read-write, 750/027 for read-only

# This sets the "group" used for the permission, if blank then $USER is used.
# By default only the user who mounted the drive can access the drive
# setting this to 'users' or any other group enables members of that group
# to access the drives too.

# This one modifies the permission bits of for "other" (o) unix permission.
# (=called as "unlisted" users because they are not member of the standard
# "users" group). If it is turned on, it will grant read/execute access 
# anyone who can access the system.
# It works by changing last digit of ACCESS_MODE to 5 (instead of 0)
# and last digit of UMASK_MODE to 2 (instead of 7).
# Not recommended to turn this on, but some Linux OS (e.g. Ubuntu) may need it
