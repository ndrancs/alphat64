Pacman is a utility which manages software packages in Linux. 
It uses simple compressed files as a package format, and maintains a text-based 
package database (more of a hierarchy), just in case some hand tweaking is necessary.
It will add, remove and upgrade packages in the system, handle dependencies 
automatically and can download packages from a remote server.

Invoking pacman involves specifying an operation with any potential options 
and targets to operate on. A target is usually a package name, filename, 
URL, or a search string. Targets can be provided as command line arguments. 

Examples (with simple text editor leafpad):
     
  pacman -Sy
  Update package list

  pacman -Ss leafpad
  Search for package leafpad in the database, searching both in packages' names and descriptions

  pacman -S leafpad
  Download and install leafpad including dependencies.
     
  pacman -Si leafpad
  Display extensive information about a given package
     
  pacman -U /path/to/package/package_name-version.pkg.tar.xz  
  Install a 'local' package that is not from a remote repository (e.g. the package is from the AUR): 

  pacman -Rs leafpad
  Remove leafpad and its dependencies which are not required by any other installed package.
