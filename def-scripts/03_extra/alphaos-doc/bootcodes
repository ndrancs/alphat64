  Kernel boot parameters are text strings which are interpreted by the system 
  to change specific behaviors and enable or disable certain features. 
  
  Kernel parameters can be set either temporarily by editing the boot menu when 
  it shows up, or by modifying the boot loader's configuration file, menu.lst.
  
  Kernel boot parameters:
  
    - are case-sensitive,

    - are sometimes just a simple word ("toram")

    - sometimes have an = sign with various possible values ("from=/alphaos/")

    - sometimes include punctuation ("i8042.noloop")
